We've plotted graphs and basic analysis techniques could be used to analyse and predict most (6 outof the 8) graphs.
For GDP Growth Rate Annual and GDP Per Capita Growth Rate annual, special algorithms have to be used.

Inferences:
1. Every graph except Annual Growth Rates (GDP and GDP Per Capita) are shown to be increasing in nature
2. Even if we consider Annual Growth Rate graphs, if we were to plot a single line through the average expected trend, we get an increasing line
	The current scenario could result in a drop in the growth rate, but the average line shows that it could increase and the mean growth rate could keep on increasing over the years
	Hopeful future
	
Predictions from the graphs



Stuff to modify:
 - Y-label and Title in graphs
 -
